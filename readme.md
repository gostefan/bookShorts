Book Shorts
===========

Description
-----------

I decided to write (more or less) short abstracts about all the technical books I'm reading from now on. This will help me to recapitulate the books faster if I ever need it.

How to compile
--------------

The abstracts are written using LaTeX. So to create the compiled version you need to install a LaTeX compiler first.

Using that compiler you should figure out what command to use - e.g. `pdflatex`. Then just compile the file that is named after the book. If there are sub-files don't let them confuse you and just compile the one .tex file named after the book.
